where dreams come true

## what's tihs?

an easy blog script that allows you to do the same as in HUGO, blogspot or Wordpress, but without all the pain

```
                      _     _
  ___  __ _ ___ _   _| |__ | | ___   __ _
 / _ \/ _` / __| | | | '_ \| |/ _ \ / _` |
|  __/ (_| \__ \ |_| | |_) | | (_) | (_| |
 \___|\__,_|___/\__, |_.__/|_|\___/ \__, |
                |___/               |___/
```

## where is the content?

the entries will be numbered, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5*.md*... and so on. just choose a random number and boom, you have one of my entries. they can be chronological, i guess... (in the future we may order it correctly, from newer to older)

*you (must) don't have to mannualy modify the below table of contents, it does it automatically (you may remove this line, though)* 

*DO NOT remove the "table of contents:" line, or the program will NOT work*

table of contents: 
  
[1. my first entry!](entries/1.html)  
[2. how to use](entries/2.html)
