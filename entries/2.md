title: how to use
---

1. go to the 'posts' directory
2. execute the 'new.fish' script
3. enter the title
4. edit the markdown file, by filling the content between the title and the date
5. save the file and close the editor
6. run the 'build' script

## important notes:

1. DO NOT write content below the table of contents, since it will be overwriten. this may be changed in the future
2. DO NOT edit the html files directly, they will be overwritten when building with 'build'. the pages must be edited via their source code, *n*.md
3. DO NOT remove the title part, or it won't be listed in the table of contents
